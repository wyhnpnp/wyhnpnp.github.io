## Photography

<br>Photography opened the door to a new world for me: I began to observe the weather, the timing of the rise and fall of the sun and moon, the forecast of sunset, meteors, and the Milky Way. **To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, to draw closer, to find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of life.** During my three years in Weihai, I took many meaningful photos and made some friends who took photos together. My camera is *Nikon Z50*, with lenses of *50-250 mm* and *16-50 mm*. In addition, I also have an *Olympus IS-5000* film camera. But in the past year, I have hardly touched them because I have devoted all my time to scientific research.

## DIY

<br>There must be something truly magical about standing on stage to give a fantastic speech, which considerably lifts my spirits and energizes my entire body. If you desire to master a specific knowledge in depth, just give a prelection. If you can explain to others for complete understanding, you are already an expert. I really enjoy the accomplishment of imparting my knowledge to others, so what I strive for is to be **a student's favorite professor** at the [best universities in my hometown].

## Past Hobbies

I previously enjoyed long-distance running, [vlog making](https://space.bilibili.com/594030035), and computer game developing/playing. However, I have no time to do any of these things recently.

## My Cat

She is my love. Her name is Qbao (QÂÆù).
