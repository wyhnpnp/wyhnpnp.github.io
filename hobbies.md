## Photography

<br>Photography opened the door to a new world for me: I began to observe the weather, the timing of the rise and fall of the sun and moon, the forecast of sunset, meteors, and the Milky Way. **To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, to draw closer, to find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of life.**

<br>During my three years in Weihai, I took many meaningful photos and made some friends who took photos together. My camera is *Nikon Z50*, with lenses of *50-250 mm* and *16-50 mm*. In addition, I also have an *Olympus IS-5000* film camera. But in the past year, I have hardly touched them because I have devoted all my time to scientific research.<br>If you like the style of my photos, then we might be kindred spirits. More photos can be viewed on my [Little Red Book](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/5b59dc27f7e8b977d3628016).

<br>I have always been interested in making handicrafts since I was young. This skill helps me improve my hands-on ability. I like origami, twisting sticks, droppers, clay, pottery, and sewing. Of course, these are all for my lover.
